# Pacman

Author: Andy Duong

Class: CPSC 386-02 

Project 2: Pacman

This program is my implementation of the classic arcade game Pacman + Portal

## Controls
Movement: Arrow Keys
Drop blue Portal: V
Drop orange Portal: R

To use the portals, press the V key to drop a blue portal behind you and then press the R key to drop a portal in front.
Portals are one-directional (orange to blue only)

## Important Notes
The file 'scores.txt' which stores the high scores on disk, initially contains 0. There must be an empty line at the end or else program will crash. It is recommended to leave it alone to be safe.

Program still contains a bug causing ghosts to "go off screen"
## Installation
1. Have Python with pygame and numpy installed.
2. Download and extract files to one directory
3. Run game.py
